    Academic advising is a collaborative process where students work with a qualified UMSI Academic Advisor to envision, implement, and evaluate their academic plans. During advising sessions, students discuss their goals, challenges, and questions, while the advisor provides expertise on university and program requirements, policies, and procedures. Together, they create an academic plan that supports the student's personal and professional aspirations.
